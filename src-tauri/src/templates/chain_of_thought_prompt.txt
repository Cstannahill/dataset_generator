Generate exactly {batch_size} high-quality Chain-of-Thought reasoning examples for: {use_case}

DOMAIN CONTEXT: {domain_context}

## CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS

Each example should demonstrate step-by-step reasoning with:
- **question**: Clear problem or query requiring reasoning
- **answer**: Structured response showing reasoning steps and final answer

## REASONING QUALITY STANDARDS

### Question Design:
- Present problems that require multiple steps to solve
- Include sufficient information for reasoning
- Vary complexity levels appropriately
- Make problems realistic and relevant

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- Break down the problem into logical steps
- Show intermediate calculations or thoughts
- Explain the rationale behind each step
- Connect steps logically to build toward solution

### Clear Structure:
- Use "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc. for organization
- Include "Final Answer:" to clearly state conclusion
- Show work for mathematical problems
- Explain reasoning for logical problems

## REASONING PATTERNS

Create examples featuring:
- **Mathematical**: Calculations, word problems, equations
- **Logical**: Deduction, inference, problem analysis
- **Analytical**: Data interpretation, trend analysis
- **Sequential**: Multi-step processes, procedures
- **Comparative**: Evaluation of options with criteria

## STEP QUALITY GUIDELINES

Each reasoning step should:
- Build logically on previous steps
- Be clearly explained and justified
- Include relevant calculations or analysis
- Move progressively toward the solution
- Be understandable to the target audience

## EXAMPLE STRUCTURE

Good Chain-of-Thought pattern:
```
Question: [Problem requiring multi-step reasoning]
Answer: 
Step 1: [First logical step with explanation]
Step 2: [Second step building on first]
Step 3: [Continue reasoning process]
Final Answer: [Clear, definitive conclusion]
```

Output ONLY valid JSON array:
[
  {"question": "...", "answer": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ... Final Answer: ..."}
]
