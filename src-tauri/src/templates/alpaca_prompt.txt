Generate exactly {batch_size} high-quality Alpaca-format training examples for: {use_case}

DOMAIN CONTEXT: {domain_context}

## ALPACA FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS

The Alpaca format consists of three fields:
- **instruction**: Clear, specific task description
- **input**: Optional context or data (can be empty string)
- **output**: Complete, helpful response

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Instruction Quality:
- Be specific about what you want the model to do
- Use action verbs (explain, analyze, create, compare, etc.)
- Include necessary constraints or requirements
- Avoid ambiguous language

### Input Usage:
- Provide context when the instruction needs it
- Include relevant data, examples, or scenarios
- Use empty string ("") when no context is needed
- Don't duplicate information from instruction

### Output Excellence:
- Directly address the instruction
- Provide complete, actionable responses
- Include examples or explanations when helpful
- Maintain appropriate length for the task

## DIVERSITY GUIDELINES

Create examples across these categories:
- **Explanatory**: Explain concepts, processes, or phenomena
- **Analytical**: Analyze data, situations, or problems
- **Creative**: Generate content, ideas, or solutions
- **Comparative**: Compare and contrast different options
- **Instructional**: Provide step-by-step guidance
- **Problem-solving**: Address specific challenges

## EXAMPLES TO FOLLOW

High-quality instruction patterns:
- "Explain [concept] to [audience] using [approach]"
- "Analyze [data/situation] and provide [specific output]"
- "Create a [type] for [purpose] that includes [requirements]"
- "Compare [A] and [B] in terms of [criteria]"

Output ONLY valid JSON array:
[
  {"instruction": "...", "input": "...", "output": "..."}
