Generate exactly {batch_size} high-quality training examples for the following fine-tuning objective:

OBJECTIVE: {use_case}
DOMAIN CONTEXT: {domain_context}
FORMAT: {format}

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

1. **Relevance**: Each example must directly serve the stated objective
2. **Quality**: Ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness in all fields
3. **Diversity**: Vary complexity levels, topics, and approaches
4. **Format Compliance**: Follow the exact structure required for {format}
5. **Practical Value**: Create realistic, useful training scenarios

## GENERATION GUIDELINES

### Content Quality Standards:
- Instructions should be clear, specific, and actionable
- Inputs should provide relevant context or data when needed
- Outputs should be comprehensive, helpful, and directly address the instruction
- Maintain professional tone while being engaging
- Ensure factual accuracy and logical consistency

### Diversity Requirements:
- Include beginner, intermediate, and advanced complexity levels
- Cover multiple sub-topics within the domain
- Use various question types and response styles
- Explore different perspectives and use cases
- Vary response lengths appropriately

### Avoid Common Issues:
- Generic or template-like responses
- Incomplete or vague instructions
- Outputs that don't match the instruction
- Repetitive patterns across examples
- Overly complex language where simplicity is better

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with no additional text or explanation:

[
  {"instruction": "...", "input": "...", "output": "..."},
  {"instruction": "...", "input": "...", "output": "..."}
]

Each entry must be complete, self-contained, and ready for training use.
