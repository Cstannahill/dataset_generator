Generate exactly {batch_size} high-quality preference ranking examples for: {use_case}

DOMAIN CONTEXT: {domain_context}

## PREFERENCE RANKING FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS

Each example should contain:
- **prompt**: User query or request
- **chosen**: High-quality, preferred response
- **rejected**: Lower-quality alternative response

## QUALITY DIFFERENTIATION STANDARDS

### Chosen Response Characteristics:
- Directly addresses the prompt completely
- Provides accurate, helpful information
- Uses appropriate tone and style
- Includes relevant details and examples
- Demonstrates expertise in the domain

### Rejected Response Characteristics:
- Partially addresses the prompt or misses key points
- Contains inaccuracies or oversimplifications
- Uses inappropriate tone or style
- Lacks important details or context
- Shows limited understanding of the topic

## QUALITY CONTRAST GUIDELINES

Create clear preference differences through:
- **Completeness**: Chosen is thorough, rejected is incomplete
- **Accuracy**: Chosen is factual, rejected has errors
- **Relevance**: Chosen stays on topic, rejected goes off-track
- **Depth**: Chosen shows understanding, rejected is superficial
- **Helpfulness**: Chosen is actionable, rejected is vague

## PREFERENCE SCENARIOS

Generate examples showing these contrasts:
- **Expert vs. Novice**: Professional insight vs. basic knowledge
- **Detailed vs. Vague**: Comprehensive vs. surface-level responses
- **Accurate vs. Flawed**: Correct information vs. misconceptions
- **Relevant vs. Off-topic**: On-point vs. tangential responses
- **Helpful vs. Unhelpful**: Actionable vs. generic advice

## REALISM REQUIREMENTS

Rejected responses should be:
- Plausibly generated by a less capable model
- Believable but clearly inferior
- Wrong in subtle or obvious ways
- Missing crucial information or context
- Demonstrating common failure modes

## BALANCE GUIDELINES

Maintain realistic quality gaps:
- Not obviously terrible vs. perfect
- Believable human preference choices
- Clear but not extreme differences
- Representing real model improvement needs
